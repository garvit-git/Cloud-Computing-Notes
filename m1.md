## What is On-demand Resource Provisioning

On-demand resource provisioning in cloud computing refers to the ability to allocate and release computing resources as needed, based on immediate requirements. It allows users to quickly scale resources up or down to meet fluctuating demands.

-   Enables users to request and obtain resources whenever they need them without committing.
-   Resources : virtual machines, storage, network bandwidth, or other cloud services.
-   Provisioning can be done manually through user interfaces or programmatically through APIs.
-   Pool of resources available for allocation to users on demand.
-   Dynamic allocation of resources based on user requests, often automated or self-service.
-   Scale during peak periods to meet high demand and scale down during low activity to save costs.
-   The provisioning process may involve deploying virtual machines, configuring storage, establishing network connections, and initializing software environments.

    **Pros**

    -   **`Scalability`** based on demands.
    -   **`Cost Efficiency`** - only pay for what you use
    -   **`Flexibility`** - allocate resources as required without long-term commitments.
    -   **`Agility`** - On-demand provisioning → deployment of resources

    **Cons**

    -   **`Cost Overruns`** - If resource usage monitored effectively, costs can escalate.
    -   **`Resource Availability`** - Resource availability is limited during peak periods or in specific regions.
    -   **`Performance Variability`** - Sharing resources with other users in a multi-tenant environment may result in performance fluctuations.
    -   **`Vendor Lock-in`** - Depending on the cloud provider's platform or APIs, users may face challenges migrating resources to a different provider.
